# How to open
Using the latest version of [Scilab](https://www.scilab.org/download/), start an instance of Xcos to begin, then load the [E-machine.xcos](./E-machine.xcos) file, and click **Start simulation**

# How to use
Interactive control of the simulation is possible using rudimentary controllers. Simple controls are provided that don't even have labels yet. Identify them by the slider ranges, detailed in the [controls manual](./doc/controls.md)
